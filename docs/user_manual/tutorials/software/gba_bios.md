Most retro-gaming console software emulators are able to run game ROMs
directly.

However, the Game Boy Advance an PS1 emulators do require an
additional BIOS file in order to emulate all or some of the game ROMs.

## GBA

If you launch a GBA game for the first time, you will get this screen:

![GBA BIOS](/assets/images/GBA_BIOS.png)

This means that you will need to install on the **FunKey S** a BIOS
file with the right name, size and MD5 checksum before you can
actually play.

- BIOS file name: gba_bios.bin
- MD5: a860e8c0b6d573d191e4ec7d
