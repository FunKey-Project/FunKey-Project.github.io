**OPK** (Open PacKage) files are archive files that contains
emulators, standalone games, applications or utilities along with all
their associated resources like icons packed into a single file that
does not require installation to be able to run them.

!!! Note

    In the current release of the FunKey-OS (DrUm78's version), the **OPK** files
    are available both for the GMenu2X and RetroFE launchers. See documentation [here.][3]

[7-Zip][1] can be used to extract **OPK** files, and [Open Package
Creator][2] is a useful tool if you want to re-package an
**OPK** or customize icons, add additional games and much more.

Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add **OPK**
files as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

Of course, you can remove **OPK** files from the **FunKey S** console
as you would do with a USB memory stick, too!
