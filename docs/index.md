# Welcome to FunKey!

![Atomic Purple FunKey S](assets/images/Atomic_Purple_FunKey_S.jpg){: align=left }

Thank you for choosing the **FunKey S**!

The **FunKey S** is the world's smallest foldable retro-gaming
console.

Because of its foldable design, the **FunKey S** provides a
surprisingly large screen and comfortable key pads while open, but it
stays compatible with a keychain usage when closed.

## Basic operation

The **FunKey S** operation is so straightforward that a 6-year old
child should be able to operate it without any user's manual for the
most common tasks. But just to make sure you are not missing
something, you can find the basic device operation description in the
[Tutorials section][1].

## More advanced features

Despite its size, the **FunKey S** is packed with features, and this
documentation will also provide more advanced tips in the [Tutorials
section][2].

## Developers

For developers, a full guide is included, with both
[Hardware][3] and [Software][4] subsections.



## Open source files

- All the **software repositories** are accessible on our [Github](https://github.com/FunKey-Project){target=_blank}. The developer section is a great way to understand its secrets.
- All the **electronic schematics** and layouts are accessible [here](https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-S-Hardware){target=_blank}.
- For mechanical tinkerers or professionals, all the **3D step files** are accessible on [Grabcad][7]{target=_blank}



## Miscellaenous stuff

Last but not least, this documentation would not be complete without a
[Glossary of terms][5] for reference.
