# How to get ROMs legally

Yes legally! Despite the general opinion, it is perfectly possible to
purchase and play famous ROMs legally such as Sonic, Castlevania,
Megaman and more, read the note below for more details.

**The FunKey Wiki** maintains [lists][1]{: target="blank"} of legal
sources for ROMs, including [freeware ROMs][2]{: target="blank"},
[commercial ROMs][3]{: target="blank"}, and [utilities][4]{:target="blank"}.

!!! note "Note about ROM emulation"

    While ROM emulation is often seen as illegal, and sometimes by
    extension emulation itself, it is simply not _true_.

    Emulating hardware is perfectly legal, no gray area about this.

    Sharing a software copy though is illegal, so websites that host
    copied ROMs or bios are illegal, as well as downloading ROMs or
    bios from them.

    However, if some videogame companies have decided not to share
    their games as ROMs, it is not the case for all of them. Many
    companies, even such giants as SEGA, ATARI or Konami sell their
    retro-games online as ROMs.

    For example, it is perfectly legal to purchase the SEGA Mega Drive
    and Genesis Classics on [Steam][5]{:target="blank"} and play Sonic
    on your **FunKey S**.

# Add ROMs to the FunKey S

Connect your **FunKey S** console to your computer and add new games
as simply as you would do it with a simple USB memory stick:

would do with a USB memory stick, too!
